# DOWNLOAD SPECIES OCCURRENCE DATA ####

# here we'll download GBIF occurrence data for an example species; after running the script and understanding how everything works, you can replace this with another species of your choice (as long as it exists on GBIF) and run it again; but note things can be quite slow if there are many occurrence points!

#changed here
myspecies <- c("Tridacna maxima")
metadata <- read.csv(paste0("../data/species_occurrence_KN/Metadata_", myspecies, "_Code1.csv"))

# mind that data download takes a long time when there are many occurrences!
#gbif_data <- occ_data(scientificName = myspecies, hasCoordinate = TRUE, limit = 50000)
#
## if your species is too widespread, you can download points only within a specified window of longitude and latitude coordinates:
##countries <- readOGR("../data/countries/world_countries.shp")  # "../" means go up one level from the current folder or working directory
#
#countries<-readOGR("../data/countries/world_countries.shp")  # "../" means go up one level from the current folder or working directory
#
#par(mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2))
#plot(countries)
#map.axes()  # add coordinates on the plot axes
## xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax coordinates of your region of interest:
##my_window <- c(176, 180, -21, -14)
##just Fiji
#
##all oceania-ish
##my_window <- c(144, 180, -21, -1)
#
#plot(as(extent(my_window), "SpatialPolygons"), border = "red", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)  # check if it's where you want it on the map
## plot country borders within 'my_window' only:
#plot(countries, xlim = my_window[1:2], ylim = my_window[3:4])
#map.axes()
## if global data is too much, download GBIF data from this window only:
#gbif_data <- occ_data(scientificName = myspecies, hasCoordinate = TRUE, limit = 50000, decimalLongitude = paste0(my_window[1:2], collapse = ", "), decimalLatitude = paste0(my_window[3:4], collapse = ", "))
#
#gbif_data  # if "Records found" is larger than "Records returned", you need to increase the 'limit' argument above (or decrease the coordinate window size) -- see help(occ_data) for options and limitations
#
## NOTE: If you plan to use these data in any report or publication, download them directly from www.gbif.org (then import the .csv to R) and note down the DOI and citation for that particular dataset. It is very important to properly cite the data sources! GBIF is not a source, just a repository for many people who put in very hard work to collect these data and make them available.
#
#
## check how the data are organized:

#names(gbif_data$meta)
#names(gbif_data$data)
#
#occurrences <- gbif_data$data
#
#unique(sapply(occurrences, class))
## some columns may be lists, which can not be saved in a .csv
#which(sapply(occurrences, class) == "list")
## remove these list columns:
#occurrences[which(sapply(occurrences, class) == "list")] <- NULL
#
## create a folder on disk and export the data as a .csv file:
#dir.create("../data/species_occurrence_KN")
#write.csv(occurrences, paste0("../data/species_occurrence_KN/occurrences_", myspecies, "_raw.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
#
## from here on, you don't need to download these data again from GBIF - you can just import them from the .csv:
#occurrences <- read.csv(paste0("../data/species_occurrence_KN/occurrences_", myspecies, "_raw.csv"))
#head(occurrences)
#
## map the occurrence records to see how they look:
#plot(countries, xlim = range(occurrences$decimalLongitude), ylim = range(occurrences$decimalLatitude), main = myspecies)
#map.axes()
#points(occurrences[ , c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude")], pch = 20, col = "red")  # compare e.g.with the range map of this species at https://www.iucnredlist.org to assess if the distribution is well represented

#
#
## CLEAN SPECIES OCCURRENCE DATA ####
#
## mind that data may contain many errors; careful mapping, inspection and cleaning are necessary!
## here we'll first remove records of absence or zero-abundance (if any):
#names(occurrences)
#sort(unique(occurrences$occurrenceStatus))  # check for different indications of "absent", which could be in different languages!
#absence_rows <- which(occurrences$occurrenceStatus %in% c("absent", "Absent", "ABSENT", "ausente", "Ausente", "AUSENTE"))
#nrow(occurrences)
#if (length(absence_rows) > 0)  occurrences <- occurrences[-absence_rows, ]
#nrow(occurrences)
#
## let's do some further data cleaning with functions of the 'scrubr' package (but note this cleaning is not exhaustive!)
#occurrences <- coord_incomplete(coord_imprecise(coord_impossible(coord_unlikely(occurrences))))
#nrow(occurrences)
#
## add the cleaned occurrence data to the map:
#points(occurrences[ , c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude")], pch = 20, col = "blue")  # excluded points are not added in blue colour
#
## also eliminate presences with reported coordinate uncertainty (location error, spatial resolution) larger than 10x10 km2 (7071 m is the distance from the centroid to the corner of a 10x10 km2 square):
#occurrences <- coord_uncertain(occurrences, coorduncertainityLimit = 7071)
#nrow(occurrences)
## but note that this will only discard records where coordinate uncertainty is adequately reported in the dataset, which may not always be the case! Careful mapping and visual inspection are necessary
#
## add these less uncertain occurrence records with a different colour on top of the previous ones:
#points(occurrences[ , c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude")], pch = 20, col = "turquoise")
#
#
#occurrences <- occurrences[grep("\\.[0-9][0-9][0-9]", occurrences$decimalLatitude), ]
#occurrences <- occurrences[grep("\\.[0-9][0-9][0-9]", occurrences$decimalLongitude), ]
#nrow(occurrences)
#
#
## add these less uncertain occurrence records with a different colour on top of the previous ones:
#points(occurrences[ , c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude")], pch = 20, col = "orange")
#
## save the cleaned data to disk as a .csv file:
#write.csv(occurrences, paste0("../data/species_occurrence_KN/occurrences_", myspecies, "_cleaned.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
#
#a <- c("Number of Editted GBIF Points in Large Window", nrow(occurrences))
#metadata<-rbind(metadata, a)
#
## see the data you have on disk so far:
#list.files("../data/species_occurrence_KN")
#
## from now on, you don't need to download and clean the data again - you can just import them from the .csv:
#occurrences <- read.csv(paste0("../data/species_occurrence_KN/occurrences_", myspecies, "_cleaned.csv"))
#head(occurrences)
#
#
# in addition to (or instead of) GBIF occurrence data, you can use presence (and absence) points for any species and source you may have, as long as they are in the same coordinate reference system (CRS) and they cover enough of the species' distribution to enable an informative model

# for the example species, Spain seems to be the only evenly surveyed country in this GBIF dataset
# also, only the mainland should be included in the modelling region, as on islands species may be limited by dispersal
# so, assuming we can't complement the dataset with occurrences from other sources (which we could!), let's select mainland Spain for modelling:
